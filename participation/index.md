# Participation
<br>
## Meet-and-greet
To foster interactions between workshop participants, we are hosting virtual meet-and-greet sessions based on the ICLR BAICS and Neuromatch "mind-matching" model. Participants will be matched with up to three other people who have similar interests and can meet during the same 30-minute timeslot. Two such sessions are built into the [workshop schedule](../program), in order to accommodate different timezones. Participants will separately also have the option to indicate whether they would like to be matched with a mentor or mentee. More information will be available soon.

## Logistics
The workshop will take place as a fully virtual event on Monday, December 13, 2021.
<!-- Please refer to the official NeurIPS workshop schedule at [https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/Schedule?showEvent=21840](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/Schedule?showEvent=21840). -->
