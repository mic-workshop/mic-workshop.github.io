# Call for papers

We invite papers from Cognitive Science, Linguistics, and Machine Learning that explore synergies between pragmatics in humans and machines. In addition to theoretical or empirical findings, we welcome "blue sky" reflections upon open problems, prospects for future development, and positions on the current state of the art. 

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

- Successful or failed integrations of pragmatics into artificial agents
- Datasets, tasks, or evaluation metrics for measuring pragmatic reasoning
- Computational models of human pragmatic reasoning
- Applications of pragmatics in artificial agents in various domains
- Surveys or replication of existing work
- Proposals for longer-term research programs

## Submission instructions
Authors may choose between two submission formats: short paper or abstract. Short papers are limited to 4 pages of content, with unlimited pages for references and appendices. Abstracts are limited to 1 page of content, with unlimited pages for references and appendices. We ask that authors use appendices only for minor details that are not necessary for understanding the paper. Submissions must be fully anonymized. The review process will be double-blind.

All accepted papers will be presented in a virtual poster session and listed on the website. A small number of accepted papers will be selected to be presented as contributed talks. We particularly encourage submissions from groups that are underrepresented at machine learning conferences based on factors including gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, nationality, disability, and institution.

The paper template and style files can be found [**here**](https://www.overleaf.com/read/fcscyxfdtqsk) (read-only Overleaf template; make a copy to edit). Do not use the standard NeurIPS style files. Please refer to the [**NeurIPS 2021 formatting instructions**](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/PaperInformation/StyleFiles) for best practices regarding style.

## Dual submission policy
We welcome papers that are currently under review, but discourage submission of papers that will be presented at the main conference or have been previously published at an ML conference. Accepted papers will be published on the workshop homepage, but will not be part of the official proceedings and are to be considered non-archival.
