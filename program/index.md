            Invited talk: "The Neurobiology of Pragmatics"
            <br><br><p style="font-size:0.75rem;">In this presentation I will discuss recent insights into both the time course of pragmatic processing and the key neural infrastructure for inferring speaker meaning from coded meaning. I will show why mirror neurons are not able to handle pragmatic information. In addition, I will present evidence for the role of the Theory of Mind (ToM) network in processing of pragmatic information.</p>

            Invited talk: "Human Production Strategies for Neural Language Generation"
            <br><br><p style="font-size:0.75rem;">Progress on language generation has experienced a huge boost with the advent of large models trained on huge amounts of text. However, this kind of language modelling will only take us that far. Most natural language use is driven by communicative goals and is often grounded both in the conversational context and in extralinguistic information. Can we take inspiration from human production strategies in situated environments to drive forward natural language generation models? I will argue that yes, we can, and present a few examples of recent and ongoing research carried out within my group that follow this research programme.</p>

            Invited talk: "The Right Words for the Job: Coordinating on Task-Relevant Conventions via Bayesian Program Learning"
            <br><br><p style="font-size:0.75rem;">In this talk, I'll argue that human-like language use in a variable and non-stationary social environment requires a more radical shift in our models of meaning. People not only rely on pragmatic reasoning to enrich static literal meanings, but flexibly create new literal meanings together to suit the task at hand. In other words, the central computational problem of communication is not simply transmission in context, as in classical formulations, but continual learning within and across social contexts. As a case study, I'll present a physical assembly task where pairs of human participants worked together to reconstruct block towers. We found that human participants rapidly coordinated on new, more abstract language that captured each scene’s underlying structure. Motivated by these findings, we extend recent hierarchical models of convention formation with a Bayesian program learning module. This model suggests a path toward more adaptive language models that are able to 'find the right words for the job' and collaborate with human partners in a wider variety of novel contexts.</p>
